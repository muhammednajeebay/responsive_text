# ResponsiveText Widget Package - Planning and Implementation

This document outlines the detailed planning and implementation roadmap for the ResponsiveText widget package, tracking all changes made and future development plans.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning (COMPLETED)

### 1.1 Package Requirements Definition

#### Core Features Implemented:
- **Dynamic Font Scaling**: 
  - Implemented two scaling modes: screen-based and container-based
  - Screen-based scaling uses MediaQuery to adapt to device width
  - Container-based scaling uses LayoutBuilder to fit text within available space
  - Binary search algorithm for optimal font size calculation

- **Min/Max Bounds**:
  - Added minFontSize and maxFontSize parameters with validation
  - Implemented stepGranularity for fine-tuning font size adjustments
  - Added clamping to ensure font sizes stay within defined bounds

- **Multi-line Support**:
  - Implemented maxLines parameter for controlling text wrapping
  - Added overflow detection and handling
  - Included softWrap control for line breaking behavior

#### Optional Features Implemented:
- **Adaptive Spacing**:
  - Added textAlign parameter for horizontal alignment control
  - Implemented textDirection support for RTL/LTR text
  - Added textScaleFactor support for system accessibility integration

- **Overflow Handling**:
  - Implemented overflow parameter with TextOverflow options (clip, ellipsis, fade)
  - Added onFontSizeChanged callback for overflow state notification
  - Included overflow detection in font size calculation

#### API Design Principles Established:
- **Developer-Friendly Usage**:
  - Created API similar to Flutter's Text widget for familiarity
  - Set sensible defaults for common use cases
  - Used clear parameter naming and comprehensive documentation

- **Flexibility**:
  - Implemented multiple adaptation strategies (screen or container)
  - Added customizable constraints and behavior options
  - Designed for extension with future features

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Used efficient binary search algorithm for size calculation
  - Implemented state management to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
  - Added caching for calculated font sizes

### 1.2 Project Structure Setup

#### Files Created/Modified:
- **pubspec.yaml**: 
  - Updated package description
  - Added repository and issue tracker links
  - Configured environment and dependencies

- **lib/responsive_text.dart**:
  - Created main library file
  - Implemented ResponsiveText widget class
  - Added comprehensive documentation

- **README.md**:
  - Created detailed documentation
  - Added usage examples for different scenarios
  - Included installation instructions

### 1.3 Research and Analysis
- Analyzed existing solutions like auto_size_text
- Identified limitations in current approaches
- Designed improvements for better performance and flexibility

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

### 2.1 Enhance ResponsiveText Widget
- [ ] Add rich text support with TextSpan
- [ ] Implement more advanced overflow handling
- [ ] Add animation support for smooth size transitions

### 2.2 Create Example App
- [ ] Create basic example demonstrating core features
- [ ] Add complex examples showing advanced usage
- [ ] Include visual comparison with standard Text widget

### 2.3 Write Tests
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add widget tests for rendering behavior
- [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (PLANNED)

### 3.1 Add Rich Text Support
- [ ] Extend functionality to handle TextSpan objects
- [ ] Ensure consistent scaling across different text styles
- [ ] Maintain proper alignment and spacing

### 3.2 Implement Fluid Typography
- [ ] Develop proportional scaling based on screen diagonal
- [ ] Add viewport-relative units (similar to CSS vw/vh)
- [ ] Create smooth transitions between size changes

### 3.3 Add Presets and Themes
- [ ] Create typography presets for common use cases
- [ ] Add theme integration for consistent styling
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints system

## Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (PLANNED)

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Expand test coverage to edge cases
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test on various device sizes and orientations

### 4.2 Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Create API reference documentation
- [ ] Add visual examples and diagrams
- [ ] Include advanced usage patterns

### 4.3 Example App Enhancement
- [ ] Add interactive demo features
- [ ] Include more complex layout examples
- [ ] Create comparison with other text sizing approaches

## Phase 5: Optimization and Refinement (PLANNED)

### 5.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Minimize rebuilds and layout calculations
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated size calculations
- [ ] Profile and optimize rendering performance

### 5.2 Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with screen readers
- [ ] Support dynamic text scaling from system settings
- [ ] Add high-contrast mode support

### 5.3 Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] Test on iOS, Android, web, and desktop
- [ ] Address platform-specific rendering issues
- [ ] Optimize for different pixel densities

## Phase 6: Publishing and Maintenance (PLANNED)

### 6.1 Prepare for Publication
- [ ] Ensure code quality with static analysis
- [ ] Verify package structure meets pub.dev requirements
- [ ] Complete package metadata and description

### 6.2 Publish to pub.dev
- [ ] Run final verification with `dart pub publish --dry-run`
- [ ] Publish package to pub.dev
- [ ] Announce release on relevant platforms

### 6.3 Establish Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Set up issue tracking
- [ ] Plan version roadmap for future features
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines

## Current Status

- **Phase 1**: COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: IN PROGRESS
- **Phases 3-6**: PLANNED

## Next Steps

1. Complete the example app to demonstrate the widget's capabilities
2. Implement comprehensive tests for the widget
3. Add rich text support and advanced features
4. Prepare for initial publication to pub.dev# ResponsiveText Widget Package - Planning and Implementation
